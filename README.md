This mirror for, errrr, like, important educational purposes, either for download [here](https://github.com/plasma4/cookieclicker/archive/refs/heads/gh-pages.zip) for your own so-called "offline education" or to be played online from http://plasma4.github.io/cookieclicker/ if you cannot "teach" yourself about how to use the original URL. It also provides various fixes and works without internet when properly downloaded.
